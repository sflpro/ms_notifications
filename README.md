## Microservice API

The public API of the microservice is exposed via HTTP REST. API client libraries are available in the followign languages :

However, any platform supporting HTTP calls can use the microservice by manually implementing HTTP calls execution logic.

## Deployment

* [Apache Tomcat 8] (http://tomcat.apache.org/)
* [Jetty](https://eclipse.org/jetty/)

## TODOs

Below you may find some of the actions planned for the near future :
* Convert the application to use [Spring Boot/Cloud](http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud/)
* Document the REST API in [Apiary](https://apiary.io/)
* Add client libraries in Python
* Add support for other SMS providers
* Expose the API via [GRPC](http://www.grpc.io/)
